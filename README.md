programmable-light-show
=======================

This project uses a BeagleBone Black as a server, with Adafruit's LPD8806 LED Strip, to create a programmable light show. The beaglebone is the server and allows people to connect to it via the internet and program the lights using Google's Blockly, a graphical program editor. The can then execute their code locally, while the led light strip attached to the beaglebone lights up accoridingly in response to messages sent from connected browsers.
