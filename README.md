programmable-light-show
=======================

This project uses a BeagleBone Black as a server, with Adafruit's LPD8806 LED Strip, to create a programmable light show. The beaglebone is the server and allows people to connect to it via the internet and program the lights using Google's Blockly and then execute their code locally, while the led light strip attached to the beaglebone responds to messages sent from connected browsers and changes the lights accordingly.
